        <div>
          With 4 years of experience across JavaScript front-end and back-end
          frameworks like React, Redux, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, I also
          bring expertise in FastAPI, PostgreSQL, AWS, Next.js, and TypeScript.
          I manage end-to-end project delivery—from requirement analysis to
          deployment—delivering solutions independently and in teams. I follow
          Agile practices using tools like Jira, GitLab, and CI/CD pipelines to
          ensure efficient workflows.
